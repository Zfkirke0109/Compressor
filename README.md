<summary>8K24 HEVC SDR - Ultra High Resolution</summary>

**266.4MB 8K 24fps HEVC SDR video compressed using the Medium preset in Compressor.**

| Device                      | Speed    | Final Size      |

| Samsung Galaxy S10 (Exynos) | 38s 07ms | 100.3MB (-60%)  |

*I'm unsure what happened here, but the S21+ lags significantly when even just playing the original 8K video in the Gallery app and is only able to do 8K playback at 15fps. Perhaps Samsung's Exynos 2100 SoC has a regression in 8K decoding performance? This is an extremely strange result, but it happened across three retries and even when an active cooling source was applied.

<summary>Old Benchmarks</summary>
How does Compressor run on different devices? All tests are completed with a 25 second, 200MB 4K video compressed using the Medium preset in Compressor.

| Device                      | Speed    |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Google Pixel 8 Pro          | 11s 61ms |
| Samsung Galaxy S25          | 7s 99ms  |
| Samsung Galaxy S10 (Exynos) | 11s 27ms |
| Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Exynos) | 20s 79ms |
| Samsung Galaxy S7 (Exynos)  | 25s 35ms |

And what about Compressor vs Panda Video Compressor, a highly rated video compression app filled with ads with 10M+ downloads. These tests were done using each app on their respective medium presets.

| Device             | Compressor | Panda Video Compressor |
|--------------------|------------|------------------------|
| Google Pixel 8 Pro | 11s 61ms   |  21m 40s 49ms          |

I ran out of time waiting for my 21 minute video compression so I only ran it on my main phone, my Pixel 8 Pro. Hopefully this gives you an idea of how much faster Compressor is compared to an outdated ffmpeg wrapper using software encoding. To be precise, it's 117x faster.

*Why are the new benchmarks worse than the old ones?* Glad you asked! The old "benchmark" video was already quite low bitrate. It was simply a video of me violently shaking my phone around for 25 seconds. The new baseline videos are much more complex and contain more detail, creating a much more accurate benchmark for real world use.

*Why have some devices been removed?* I removed the Galaxy S8+ because it was running a custom ROM which may have unfairly affected its score. The Galaxy S25 was removed as I do not have access to it anymore (I got a friend to do the testing for me, and I don't want to bother them to retest). **The Galaxy S21+ will not be included in future tests as it is now broken and I can no longer test on it.**

*Why are there new devices added?* I added the Galaxy S9 and ~~S21+~~ to get a more complete picture of how Compressor performs on older flagships. The Galaxy A71, A32 and A05s were added to see how Compressor performs on older midrange devices and newer budget devices. All three of these categories make up a significant amount of my Play Store users, so I wanted to make sure Compressor performs well on them.
